### Where to Start

#### Basic Knowledge

- It is recommended to work in a virtual environment like an `Kali Linux` instance running on `VirtualBox` or `VMware Player`.
- Make sure you downloaded the correct `.ovpn` file to connect to the network and access your box.

```c
$ sudo openvpn /PATH/TO/OVPNFILE/<USERNAME>.ovpn
```

- Wordlists are usually located in `/usr/share/wordlists/`. The mostly used ones are:
	- rockyou.txt (sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz)
	- /usr/share/wordlists/seclists (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
- If you are missing some tools, try to install them from the `Kali Linux repository`.

```c
$ sudo apt-get install kali-linux-everything
```

- If a website is not reachable via `IP address` and redirects you, try to add it to the `/etc/hosts` file.
- Always familiarize yourself with the tools you use and checkout their documentation as well as the parameter `-h`.
- Don't run exploits from the internet without understanding what they are doing.

#### First Steps

There are some basic things you should be aware about when you approaching a new box.

- Make sure to take proper `notes`. Probably you want to concider to write them in `Markdown` and `Obsidian` for example. Here are a few alternatives:
	- [cherrytree](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree)
	- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
	- [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)
- Always keep some sort of `reconnaissance` running in the background like `directory busting` with `Gobuster`, which can take some time.
- Make sure to `enumerate` every service and every endpoint properly. On a website for example, check for `usernames`, `email address schemes`, check the `source` of the website `click` or `hover over` every `link` you can find to see if they lead to something.
- Check for already known `vulnerabilities` and `exploits`. Therefore you can just use `Google`. Here are a few examples:
	- `<APPLICATION> vulnerability`
	- `<APPLICATION> <VERSION> vulnerability`
	- `<APPLICATION> <VERSION> exploit`
	- `<APPLICATION> <VERSION> poc`
	- `<APPLICATION> <VERSION> github`
	- `<APPLICATION> <VERSION> github poc`
	Alternatively check [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/), [Sploitus](https://sploitus.com/) or use `searchsploit` from the command line.

```c
$ searchsploit <APPLICATION>
```

- Try `default credentials` (https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet) or `admin:admin`. Especially on `web applications`.
- If you find credentials or just a password, always go for `credential reuse` and try if they work for another user as well.

#### Checklist

Depending on what a box offers to you, you can go through the following checklist.

1. Run nmap!

```c
$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- <RHOST>
$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -Pn -p- <RHOST>
$ sudo nmap -sV -sU <RHOST>
```

2. If a webserver is available, check `robots.txt`.

> http://RHOST/robots.txt

3. Also, give `whatweb` a try.

```c
$ whatweb http://<RHOST>
```

4. Ob websites, try `directory busting` with different wordlists.

```c
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt
```

5. Checking for `subdomains`. If a box offers you a `vhost` entry like `http://openadmin.htb/` for example, it is always worth it to see if there are more `vhosts` configured.

```c
$ gobuster vhost -u <RHOST> -t 50 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt
$ gobuster vhost -u <RHOST> -t 50 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
```

```c
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.openadmin.htb" -u http://openadmin.htb --mc all --fs <NUMBER>
```
  
6. Intercept `web requests` with `Burp Suite`. Without getting to deep into the usage of `Burp Suite`, here are the steps to configure it in your browser.
  - Start `Burp Suite` and open your browser on `http://burp`.
  - Then download the `CA Certificate`.
  - Depending on your browser, switch to `settings` and then to `certificates`.
  - Import the `certificate`.
  - We recommend to use [FoxyProxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) and configure it there but you can also go with the `proxy settings` of your browser.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Proxy Type | HTTP |
| Proxy IP address or DNS name | 127.0.0.1 |
| Port | 8080 |
  
  - In `Burp Suite` switch to `Target` > `Proxy settings` and select `Use advanced scope control`.
  - Add the `IP address` of the box you are approaching.
  - Switch to the `Proxy` tab, move to `Intercept` and click on `Intercept is off` to enable it.
  - At last switch the proxy in `FoxyProxy` to the `Burp Suite configuration` and access the website. Now you can intercept the web traffic coming from and going to the box and modify as you want.
